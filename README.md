This repository contains the foundational research and technical specifications for the **Agri-Compute Nexus**, a decentralized model for building sustainable data centers powered by local agricultural waste via pyrolysis.

Our mission is to establish this concept as **public prior art**, preventing proprietary enclosure and empowering communities to build resilient, self-sustaining infrastructure.

## The Core Concept

The model creates a symbiotic relationship between technology and agriculture:
1.  **Input:** Local agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover, rice straw, hemp) are sourced from farmers.
2.  **Process:** An on-site pyrolysis unit converts this biomass into syngas and biochar.
3.  **Output:** Syngas provides reliable baseload power for a co-located modular data center, while the biochar is returned to farmers to sequester carbon and improve soil health.

### An Official Blueprint Repository of the Unified Conscious Evolution Framework (UCF)

This project serves as a **Blueprint Repository** within the [Unified Conscious Evolution Framework (UCF)](https://github.com/dj-ccs/Unified-Conscious-Evolution-Framework). Its purpose is to provide a complete, open-source, and implementation-ready plan for physical, regenerative infrastructure.

Symbiotic Grid is the "hardware" that generates the real-world outcomes our software labs are designed to measure and value:
*   The **verifiable ecosystem health data** (biochar carbon sequestration, improved soil health) produced by this system is designed to be valued by the **[EHDC (Pillar IV) Lab](https://github.com/dj-ccs/EHDC)**.
*   The **research, data, and operational findings** from this model are designed to be published and peer-reviewed on the **[Open Science DLT (Pillar I) Lab](https://github.com/dj-ccs/open-science-dlt)**.

## The Whitepaper

The complete technical and economic analysis is available in our foundational whitepaper.

**[>> Download the Full Whitepaper PDF (Version 09)](whitepaper/Symbiotic-Grid_v09.pdf)**

The paper includes:
- Detailed technical parameters for pyrolysis and energy conversion.
- A complete economic model based on a "symbiotic revenue stack" (carbon credits, biochar sales, energy/data services).
- An in-depth case study for Australia's Riverina region.
- A framework for deploying drought-tolerant feedstocks like industrial hemp.
