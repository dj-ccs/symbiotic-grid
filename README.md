# The Symbiotic Grid: An Open-Source Blueprint for the Agri-Compute Nexus

![System Architecture Diagram](diagrams/system_architecture.png)

This repository contains the foundational research and technical specifications for the **Agri-Compute Nexus**, a decentralized model for building sustainable data centers powered by local agricultural waste via pyrolysis.

Our mission is to establish this concept as **public prior art**, preventing proprietary enclosure and empowering communities to build resilient, self-sustaining infrastructure.

## The Core Concept

The model creates a symbiotic relationship between technology and agriculture:
1.  **Input:** Local agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover, rice straw, hemp) are sourced from farmers.
2.  **Process:** An on-site pyrolysis unit converts this biomass into syngas and biochar.
3.  **Output:** Syngas provides reliable baseload power for a co-located modular data center, while the biochar is returned to farmers to sequester carbon and improve soil health.

## The Whitepaper

The complete technical and economic analysis is available in our foundational whitepaper.

The paper includes:
- Detailed technical parameters for pyrolysis and energy conversion.
- A complete economic model based on a "symbiotic revenue stack" (carbon credits, biochar sales, energy/data services).
- An in-depth case study for Australia's Riverina region.
- A framework for deploying drought-tolerant feedstocks like industrial hemp.
